# Module-3 Lab

## The Problem
Build the ItemToPurchase class with the following specifications: default constructor, setter and getter, and private data members. Setter and getter will edit itemName, itemPrice, and itemQuantity. They are intialized by edefault of "none" and 0.
## Example Output
If the input is: 
```Chocolate Chips 3 1 Bottled Water 1 10```



The program should output
```Total cost Chocolate Chips 1 @ $3 = $3 Bottled Water 10 @ $1 = $10  Total: $13```

## The Solution
Create the necessary header and cpp files to perform the function the lab requries.
