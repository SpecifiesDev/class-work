# Module-2 Lab

## The Problem
Mad Libs are activities that have a person provide various words, which are then used to complete a short story in unexpected (and hopefully funny) ways.

Write a program that takes a string and an integer as input, and outputs a sentence using the input values as shown in the example below. The program repeats until the input string is quit and disregards the integer input that follows.

## Example Output
If the input is: 
```apples 5
shoes 2
quit 0```



The program should output
```
Eating 5 apples a day keeps you happy and healthy.
Eating 2 shoes a day keeps you happy and healthy.```

## The Solution
Write a loop that will take user input, printing in the appropriate format until the quit string is detected.
